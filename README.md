# Cooking Dash Daily Goals Cheat Sheet
 
When you’ve completed most of the shows in Cooking Dash and just want to earn additional free gold in Daily Goals, it can be cumbersome to do trial and error to finish the required task. Not too long ago I’ve come up with a small cheat sheet for Cooking Dash Daily Goals. These are the most common tasks in Daily Goals that I have repeatedly accomplished. I saved myself the trouble of trial and error by listing some of them. Not a complete list but this will definitely help save you time and supplies. An IMPORTANT NOTE to remember, though, is a required number in a daily goal can sometimes only be achieved by using that particular show’s own VIP/Auto Chef as opposed to using either Cray Teaque or Richard Loco Moco. I would use either of the two especially if I have not purchased the show’s VIP/Auto Chef yet, which sometimes require I play the episode again in order to reach the daily goal.  As for the treasure hunt, sometimes the required amount for a recipe is over fifties and some required recipes are scarcely served in other episodes. I would keep playing that one best episode that serves 4 instead of having to play the second best episode that has 3. I always keep this post updated and I do appreciate the feedback as it helps me to refer back to my Excel file for the overall list.
